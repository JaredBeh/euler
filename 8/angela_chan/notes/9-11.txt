Aim: C what I did there?
Do Now:
   From yesterday:
   	4.) Figure out what gcc does.
	5.) Copy woohoo.c from your home directory to a /code/ directory on
	    homer. (Assume you are not working on homer yourself)
   Today:
	List the java primitive variable types.
4.) man gcc (man = manual, for any command)
5.) scp woohoo.c homer.stuy.edu:/code/
    woohoo.c is the source, homer.stuy.edu:/code/ is the destination
    scp: secure copy from local to remote machine & vice versa
    	 slower than ftp (file transfer process), but secure
	 can also say scp woohoo.c dw@homer.stuy.edu:/code/
